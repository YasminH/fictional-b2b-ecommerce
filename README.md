This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). Components are added via [Shadcn/ui cli](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) and are generated using AI via [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/), with a few manual fixes added so it doesn't break the build. This repo is to show how far v0 can go with building an ecommerce application from scratch. The first prompt was "Can you create a product page and shopping cart for a fictional b2b ecommerce?".

I deployed using Vercel. You can view it [here](https://fictional-b2b-ecommerce.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
